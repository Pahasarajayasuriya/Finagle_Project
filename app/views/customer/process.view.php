Price is no doubt an important criterion, but the Eemphasis is on consistent quality where procurement of raw and packing material is concerned. While incoming goods are subject to thorough quality inspections, all suppliers of raw and packing material are periodically audited for compliance to quality guidelines. Wherever and whenever necessary, we provide advice to assist suppliers to improve their processes. Our Quality Assurance team does an excellent job in this respect. We also ensure that all imported ingredients are sourced from reputed and quality certified organisations.</p>
